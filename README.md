# Resultat Typeface

Resultat is a mechanical sans-serif with a humanistic touch that I made as a part of my thesis in 2012. I designed it to be used as a body typeface and it has a basic latin language support. It’s designen with screens and handheld devices in mind, but it works equaly well in print.

Resultat was made in 2012 as a part of my bachelors thesis at [Arcada Universtiy of Applied Sciences](http://arcada.fi/). Special thanks to Christoffer Leka, Jutta Törnqvist and Saku Heinänen.
